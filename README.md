plugin.video.bbcsportstreams
============================

A very simple Kodi addon providing direct access to some streams used by the 
BBC to broadcast special events. The number of streams that provide actual 
content vary per event.

This addon is created for personal use only, but shared just in case it might 
be of use to someone. There is no active support. Streams may break any time 
and will probably only rarely get updated. 

Feel free to file issue, create pull request or post remarks in the discussions 
section, but just don't expect to get and instant reaction.
